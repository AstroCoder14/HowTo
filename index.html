        <h3 class="title">An example of what you will need:</h3>
        <p>Most people would think that you would need 20 Pokemon, 20 trainers, and 20 energy, but you actually need only 9-16 Pokemon. The following cards are from one of the best decks of 2023.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mew V --- x4</li>
            <li>Mew VMAX --- x3</li>
            <li>Genesect V --- x4</li>
            <li>Meloetta ---- x1</li>
            <li>Oricorio --- x1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, there are 13 cards in this deck. It is okay to go over 16 cards, but that limits the amount of trainers and energies you can have.</p>

        <h3 class="title">An example of what you will need:</h3>
        <p>For decks, I would advise at least 28 trainers, but 32+ is recomended in my opinion. The deck for Mew VMAX has 40 trainers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elesa's Sparkles --- x2</li>
            <li>Boss's Orders --- x2</li>
            <li>Iono --- x1</li>
            <li>Judge --- x1</li>
            <li>Power Tablets --- x4</li>
            <li>Battle VIP Pass --- x4</li>
            <li>Ultra Ball --- x4</li>
            <li>Cram-O-Matic --- x4</li>
            <li>Nest Ball --- x2</li>
            <li>Lost Vaccum --- x2</li>
            <li>Switch Cart --- x2</li>
            <li>Escape Rope --- x1</li>
            <li>Pal Pad --- x1</li>
            <li>Forest Seal Stone --- x3</li>
            <li>Choice Belt ---- x2</li>
            <li>Box Of Disaster --- x1</li>
            <li>Lost City --- x 2</li>
            <li>Path To The Peak --- x1</li>
            <li>Crystal Cave --- x1</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">An example of what you will need:</h3>
        <p>Depending on your deck, you can run from 6 to 20 energy cards, and there's even a deck that uses none! This deck uses only seven, but it works very well with only seven. It really depends how the deck is set up.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fusion Strike Energy --- x4</li>
            <li>Double Turbo Energy --- x3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This deck uses no regular energy cards.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This is the finished deck example.</p>
